A license represents a VR license which can be used to create and run a tournament
with VR's tournament planner.

When a tournament is pulled in through the VRAPI it always contains the name of the
license that was used to last upload the tournament.

If the license is already known, fine.  If not, it is created with a province of "TBD"
which is later adjusted by an administrative user through a small web application.
